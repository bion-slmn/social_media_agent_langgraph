![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green?style=flat-square)

An intelligent, agent-based workflow for generating content and images using automated research, LLMs, and human review. Powered by [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), this project streamlines the entire content production process—from fetching research data to delivering polished text and visuals.


## 🗺️ Workflow Overview

This workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Research**: Automatically collects and reads web content.
2. **Content Generation**: Generates draft content using a language model.
3. **Human Review**: Optional human validation and feedback.
4. **Revision**: Updates content based on review.
5. **Image Check & Generation**: Determines if an image is needed and generates it.
6. **Finalize**: Ends the workflow and outputs the results.
